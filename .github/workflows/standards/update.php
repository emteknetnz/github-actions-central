// this needs to create a pull-request with the relevant changes
// - git clone the module that needs updating?
// - or can i just send raw files to the API without first cloning the repo?
// - file_get_contents static templates that should copied in
// - for scanned things like .travis.yml, need to create a new github actions ci.yml workflow file
// - which i'll copy in from templates, and add in composer_require_extra
// - also delete .travis.yml while I'm at it
